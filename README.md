# project-gym-elo-backend
* This is the main backend for the gym-elo project. This might be split as the project progresses and we want multiple backends set up.
* Please use 'npm run start' to connect, development testing using postman
* Route files contain CRUD logic, leveraging functions exported from the Controller files for safety and simplicity

## Architecture
* The backend uses JavaScript with ExpressJS for the framework. As we expand, we will also use Docker to manage our applications. We will also be using MongoDB with Mongoose for the database.
